## Introduction 
 
 We are a group of four people that is studying at a bootcamp called Wild Code School. 
 There are three people from Madrid and one from Barcelona Campus. 
 We was a assign for our second project of the bootcamp. 
 To create a project by using React and with a use of an API of our choice.
 
 How we came up with with this idea of an Travel budget application. 
 Is because all four of us, has experience of traveling and love to explore the world. 
 We wanted to come out with an idea how we could solve 
 a problem that is the most common by travelers when traveling("At least few of them"). 
 How to keep track of there expenses and how much you have left spending of your trip. 
 It is easy to spend money when you are having a good time. 
 At least that we are experiencing. 
 
 Thats why we came up with an idea, why not have an application
 where you can keep track of all of your expenses and how much you have left in one Application. 
 Also to check the amout of the currency you have saved to the country you are visiting.
 In that way it is actually more easier to keep track and more accurate to see how much you
 have left of our budget. 
 
 From there we startet our project to find this solution.
